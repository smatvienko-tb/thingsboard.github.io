[AM300 series]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"} is a compact indoor ambiance monitoring sensor for measurement of temperature, humidity, light, CO2 concentration, barometric pressure, PM2.5, PM10 and motion. 
The data will be shown on the E-ink screen in real-time, which helps to measure the indoor environment and comfort. 
AM300 series is widely used for offices, stores, classrooms, hospitals, etc. Sensor data is transmitted using LoRaWAN ® technology. 
Using Milesight LoRaWAN® gateway and ThingsBoard, users can manage all sensor data remotely and visually.

<br><br><br>
Features of the AM300 series device:
- Integrated with multiple sensors like humidity, temperature, CO2, level light, barometric pressure, PM2.5, PM10, etc. Multiple display modes and clear emoticons to easily understand the comfort levels via screen;
- Support batteries or DC power supply;
- Equipped with traffic light indicator and buzzer to indicate device status and threshold alarms;
- Able to store locally more than 18, 000 records of 512 KB in total;
- Compliant with standard LoRaWAN® gateways and network servers.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Device connection

According to the [official user manual]({{officialManualLink}}){: target="_blank"}, we need a smartphone with NFC enabled and the ToolBox application to connect the sensor.  
Since this device can only be operated using a LoRaWAN® gateway, we must first connect it to a network server that has an integration configured with ThingsBoard.  
Afterward, it can be provisioned to ThingsBoard.

{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/devices-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:
