## Introduction

![{{deviceName}}](https://img.thingsboard.io/devices-library/{{page.deviceImageFileName}}){: style="float: left; max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px"}
[Milesight VS121]({{deviceVendorLink}}){: target="_blank"}, is an AI workplace sensor designed to monitor occupancy and utilization in modern workspaces, which can reach up to 98% recognition rate based on its AI algorithm. 
Milesight VS121 is available in dual versions that transmit data through LoRaWAN速 or Ethernet for different applications. Based on standard Lorawan protocol, VS121 can work with the Milesight gateway. 
It is equipped with WI-FI for easy configuration without the need for any additional configuration tools. By connecting this device to the ThingsBoard, you can get improved visualization and data management capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To continue with this guide we will need the following:  
{{ prerequisites }}
- [ThingsBoard account]({{ thingsboardHost }}){: target="_blank"}

## Device connection

According to the [official user manual]({{officialManualLink}}){: target="_blank"} and this guide, you can connect the device  to the network and get access to the Web UI via wireless connection.
Since this device can only be operated using a LoRaWAN速 gateway, we must first connect it to a network server that has an integration configured with ThingsBoard.

{% assign articleFilename = page.name |  replace: ".md", "" %}
{% assign guideFilePath = "/docs/devices-library/blocks/ready-to-go-devices/" | append: articleFilename | append: "-configuration-block.md" %}

{% include {{ guideFilePath }} %}

{% endif %}

To configure the device we also need to add it to a network server, so select the network server your gateway is connected to:
