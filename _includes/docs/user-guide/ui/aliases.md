Alias is a reference to a single entity or group of entities that are used in the widgets. Alias may be static or dynamic.

They can range from a simple reference to a single device to a complex search query for specific assets from a list.

In this tutorial, aliases will be used in the system according to the scheme shown below. And all devices transmit telemetry values - "temperature".

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this guide, it's recommended that you follow [Getting Started](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}getting-started-guides/helloworld/) guide to become familiar with ThingsBoard devices, dashboards and widgets. This will enhance your learning experience and understanding of the concepts presented here.

## Creating alias

To create an alias, you need to define the entities from which data will be extracted.

Then follow these steps:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="create-alias" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Now, let’s use the added alias in a widget:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="use-alias-in-widget" showListImageTitles="true" %}

## Alias types

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
In the ThingsBoard, there are various types of aliases, each offering different capabilities for configuring widgets: [Single entity](#single-entity), [Entity list](#entity-list), [Entity name](#entity-name), [Entity type](#entity-type), [Entity from dashboard state](#entity-from-dashboard-state), [Asset type](#asset-type), [Device type](#device-type), [Entity view type](#entity-view-type), [Edge type](#edge-type), [Api Usage State](#api-usage-state), [Relations query](#relations-query), [Asset search query](#asset-search-query), [Device search query](#device-search-query), [Entity view search query](#entity-view-search-query), and [Edge search query](#edge-search-query).
{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
In the ThingsBoard, there are various types of aliases, each offering different capabilities for configuring widgets: [Single entity](#single-entity), [Group entities](#group-entities), [Entity list](#entity-list), [Entity name](#entity-name), [Entity type](#entity-type), [Entity group list](#entity-group-list), [Entities by group name](#entities-by-group-name), [Entity from dashboard state](#entity-from-dashboard-state), [Owner of entity from dashboard state](#owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state), [Asset type](#asset-type), [Device type](#device-type), [Entity view type](#entity-view-type), [Edge type](#edge-type), [Api Usage State](#api-usage-state), [Relations query](#relations-query), [Asset search query](#asset-search-query), [Device search query](#device-search-query), [Entity view search query](#entity-view-search-query), [Edge search query](#edge-search-query), and [Scheduler events](#scheduler-events).
{% endif %}

They provide flexibility and powerful capabilities for configuring dashboards in ThingsBoard, allowing users to efficiently organize and visualize data from various sources.

Let's take a look at each of them.

### Single entity

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
This alias allows choosing a single entity. It can be a device, asset, entity view, tenant, customer, user, dashboard, edge, current customer, current tenant, current user or current user owner.
{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
This alias allows choosing a single entity. It can be a device, asset, entity view, tenant, customer, dashboard, user, data converter, integration, scheduler event, blob entity, role, edge, current customer, current tenant, current user or current user owner.
{% endif %}

Adding an alias: in the "Add alias" dialog, enter the alias name, and select the "Single entity" filter type. Then choose the entity type and specify the final entity.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="single-alias-1" %}

In this example, an alias has been created that filters one device - Thermometer A1. 

Let's use an added alias in a widget. In the "Tables" widgets bundle select the "Entities table" widget. Navigate to the "Entity alias" tab. Specify the "Single entity" alias in the "Entity alias" field and "temperature" data key in the "Columns" section. Click "Add" and apply changes. 
The Entities table widget with the alias that displays one device - Thermometer A1 has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="single-alias-2" %}

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
### Group entities

This alias allows choosing one entity group as the data source. It can be a device group, asset group, entity view group, customer group, dashboard group, user group and edge group.

Adding an alias: in the "Add alias" dialog, enter the alias name, and select the "Group entities" filter type. Then choose the entities type and select the entity group.

The Entities table widget with alias that filters devices, which names start with ‘Compressor’, has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-name-2" %}

### Entity type

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
This alias allows you to display all your entities and your customers' entities of the specified type. These objects can be devices, assets, entity views, tenants, customers, users, dashboards or edges.
{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
This alias allows you to display all your entities and your customers' entities of the specified type. These objects can be devices, assets, entity views, tenants, customers, dashboards, users, data converters, integrations, scheduler events, blob entities, rales or edges.
{% endif %}

Adding an alias: in the "Add Alias" dialog, enter the alias name, select the filter as "Entity Type", and choose the entity type.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-type-1" %}

This alias displays all your and your customers' devices. 

Let's use an added alias in a widget. In the "Tables" widgets bundle select the "Entities table" widget. Navigate to the "Entity alias" tab. Specify the "Entity type" alias in the "Entity alias" field and "temperature" data key in the "Columns" section. Click "Add" and apply changes. 
The Entities table widget displaying all your devices and your customers' devices has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-type-2" %}

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
### Entity group list

This alias allows you to display a list of entity groups, which can include device group(s), asset group(s), entity view group(s), customer group(s), dashboard group(s), user group(s) or edge group(s).

Adding an alias: in the “Add alias” dialog, enter the alias name, and select the "Entity group list" filter. Then select the entity type and specify entity groups you want to display on the widget.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-group-list-1" %}

This alias displays a list of device groups, which in this case are "Compressors" and "Thermostats". 

Let's use an added alias in a widget. In the "Tables" widgets bundle select the "Entities table" widget. Navigate to the "Entity alias" tab. Specify the "Entity group list" alias in the "Entity alias" field. Click "Add" and apply changes.
The Entities table widget displaying a list of device groups has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-group-list-2" %}

### Entity group name

This alias allows you to display multiple entity name groups that begin with an entered query.
They can include device groups, asset groups, entity view groups, customer groups, dashboard groups, user groups, or edge groups.

Adding an alias: in the “Add alias” dialog, enter the alias name, and select the "Entity group name" filter type. Then choose the entity type and enter an expression that will filter the names of the displayed entity groups.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-group-name-1" %}

This alias displays device groups whose names start with "Compressor".

Let’s use an added alias in a widget. In the "Tables" widgets bundle select the "Entities table" widget. Navigate to the "Entity alias" tab. Specify the "Entity group name" alias in the “Entity alias” field. Click "Add" and apply changes.
The Entities table widget, displaying device groups whose name begins with the entered query, has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-group-name-2" %}

### Entities by group name

This alias allows filtering entities by entering the exact full name of a group whose entities you want to display in the widget.
They can include device groups, asset groups, entity view groups, customer groups, dashboard groups, user groups, or edge groups.

The difference between the "Entities by group name" alias and the "[Group entities](#group-entities)" alias is that the former resolves the group by the specified name while the latter uses a hard-coded group ID.
More importantly, during the lookup of entities, this alias will use information about the current user. 
So, if you share the dashboard with multiple customers, and would like each customer to see devices that belong to them, you should use this alias instead of "Group entities".

Adding an alias: in the "Add alias" dialog, enter the alias name, and select the "Entities by group name" filter type. Then select an entity type and enter the exact full name of a group whose entities you want to display.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entities-by-group-name-1" %}

This alias filters device group by name - "Compressors". 

Let’s use an added alias in a widget. In the "Tables" widgets bundle select the "Entities table" widget. 
Navigate to the "Entity alias" tab. Specify the "Entities by group name" alias in the "Entity alias" field and "temperature" data key in the "Columns" section. Click "Add" and apply changes.
The Entities table widget that displays entities filtered by the exact full name of the entity group entered has been added.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entities-by-group-name-2" %}
{% endif %}

### Entity from dashboard state

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
This alias allows choosing one or more entities from the dashboard state. The entities can be a device, asset, entity view, tenant, customer, user, dashboard, edge, current customer, current tenant, current user, or current user owner.
{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
This alias allows choosing one or more entities from the dashboard state. The entities can be a device, asset, entity view, tenant, customer, dashboard, user, data converter, integration, scheduler event, blob entity, role, edge, current customer, current tenant, current user, or current user owner.
{% endif %}

For example, if Entities table widget is created on a [root dashboard state](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/#states) with several entities displayed on it, and you'd like to create a dashboard state which will display a widget with the entity you clicked on, you need to use this alias.

Adding an alias: in the "Add alias" dialog, enter the alias name, and select the filter type "Entity from dashboard state". Then click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-from-dashboard-state-1" %}

This alias is used for filtering data for other dashboard states.

{% if docsPrefix == null %}
For the next example, we will need two aliases: the previously discussed "[Entity type](#entity-type)" alias and the "Entity from dashboard state" alias. Let's start:

First we need to create an Entity table widget that will display a list of entities: add an Entities table widget that will display a list of entities. Use the "Entity type" alias as a data source.
{% endif %}
{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
For the next example, we will need two aliases: the previously discussed "[Group entities](#group-entities)" alias and the "Entity from dashboard state" alias. Let's start:

First we need to create an Entity table widget that will display a list of entities: add an Entities table widget that will display a list of entities. Use the "Group entities" alias as a data source.
{% endif %}

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-from-dashboard-state-2" %}

After adding the Entities table widget, add a new a [state](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/dashboards/#states):

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-from-dashboard-state-3" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Time to add an [action](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/widget-actions) to a root dashboard widget and execute it using an Entity from dashboard state alias on the widget in the created state:

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-from-dashboard-state-4" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Now, click the action button next to any entity. You will be transitioned to an inner state, which contains a widget with the details of the selected entity.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="entity-from-dashboard-state-5" %}

{% if (docsPrefix == "pe/") or (docsPrefix contains "paas/") %}
### Owner of entity from dashboard state

This alias allows displaying owners of the devices, assets, entities, etc. Commonly used when there is a hierarchy of customers, providing visibility into which devices belong to whom.

Adding an alias: in the “Add alias” dialog, enter the alias name, and select the filter type "Owner of entity from dashboard state". Then click "Add".

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state-1" %}

Let’s learn how to use the "Owner of entity from dashboard state" alias to display device owners on the widget.

For the next example, we will need two aliases: the previously discussed "[Entity type](#entity-type)" alias and the "Owner of entity from dashboard state" alias.

First let's add an Entity table widget that will display a list of all devices. Use the “Entity type” alias as a data source.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state-2" %}

Add another Entities table widget that will display the owner of the selected device. Specify the "Owner of entity from dashboard state" alias in the "Entity alias" field. Click the "Add" button in the lower right corner;

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state-3" %}

Now we need to add an [action](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/ui/widget-actions) that updates the current state of the dashboard.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state-4" showListImageTitles="true" %}

Click on the row with the device name in the "Entities" widget. The action will be executed, and the owner of the selected device will be displayed in the "Device Owner" widget.

{% include images-gallery.html imageCollection="owner-of-entity-from-dashboard-state-5" %}
{% endif %}
