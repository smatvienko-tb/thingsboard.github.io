## Overview

ThingsBoard PE [white-labeling](/docs/pe/user-guide/white-labeling/) feature allows you to configure your company or product logo and color scheme.
In addition to the ThingsBoard web interface, the white-label settings also apply to the ThingsBoard PE Mobile app.

**Note:**  By default system level login white-labeling is applied (configured by System administrator). Each tenant can override these settings by specifying
**Domain name** in the **Login White Labeling** form.
In this case tenant level settings will be applied according to the domain name of api endpoint configured in the mobile app
(value of **thingsBoardApiEndpoint** constant in **lib/constants/app_constants.dart**).
